Make a website about your major, computer information systems, and the opportunities in this major. This website should have four pages. The main page should have information about the field of information technology and the courses you would take in a typical CIS program. Also, add reasons why you decided to major in CIS. Finally, the main page should have three links. Each link will link to a page that will have information about a position that you may want to obtain after graduating with your CIS degree. Some examples are web programmer, system analyst, and database administrator. It is left up to you which positions you would like to pursue and hence, create three different pages to describe. The pages that describe the position should have duties of the position, expected growth, outlook, salaries, working conditions, major companies that hire for that particular position, related images (at least 3), and so forth.

Each page must have at least three graphical elements. You must implement the CSS features listed below.

Box Model

Floating Elements

Borders

Remember that this website should be well-organized, informative, and attractive. Use colors and great graphics to make this web page interesting so that you can attract more business.
